	<ul>
		<li><i> There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is
				here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is
				another theory which states that this has already happened.</i> </li>
		<li><i>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate
				the ingenuity of complete fools.</i></li>
		<li><i>Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not
				again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would
				know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.</i></li>
		<li><i> The chances of finding out whatâ€™s really going on in the universe are so remote, the only thing to do is
				hang the sense of it and keep yourself occupied.</i></li>
